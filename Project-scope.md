## Project Scope

The basic idea of the app is that it gives the user an overview of traffic accidents that have occurred on different roads in Sweden.
The web app is going to use a map API from Google as the base and then use an API for traffic accidents from ![Trafikverkets database](https://api.trafikinfo.trafikverket.se/)
in order to gather info on roads which are accident-prone, so that the user knows which roads to be cautious on.

Some additional features to the project could be a search function where you can search for a smaller portion of the map showing cities,
roads, and regions, but also a filter function to display different kinds of accidents, weather conditions on the road, and in which time
intervals accidents should be gathered from.

Primarily, two sustainable development goals can be directly related to the project. The following are some ways that this project can
support sustainable development goals:

The project is related to the third UN goal, which is to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. A project like
this can contribute to reducing the number of deaths and injuries that occur in road traffic accidents and thereby promoting universal 
well-being. By making the user avoid dangerous roads, you reduce the risk of traffic accidents and reduce the number of global deaths
and injuries.

Our application is also related to the 11th UN goal, which is to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and
sustainable. The application contributes  to smoother and safer infrastructure by making people avoid dangerous and accident-prone roads.
If a road has a lot of accidents, it can give infrastructure planners a heads up on how to plan to avoid accidents, which corresponds
with the sub-goal to “establish sustainable transport”. Transportation planning within cities and regions will be easier and smoother
because drivers will know what roads to avoid due to traffic jams caused by accidents.

Furthermore one could argue that our application is connected to the ninth UN goal, which is to build resilient infrastructure. The road
network is an important infrastructure and our applications highlights flawed and dangerous roads.

In our opinion the most difficult part of the application is the “Route conditions” feature. We should implement it in coexistence with
Google Routes API and visualize it in the easiest way for the final user.

The second reason is that data must be updated almost constantly to account for real-time updates. So if the realtime is not working as 
it should the application will not be as planned. 

Another part of difficulty is if the APIs data is not updating often and because of that the application will not be up-to-date, furthermore,
we should use the recent data, because of possible road modifications, our data starts in the 1950’s, so we should fit our data in the best
way possible.
